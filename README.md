# Autonomous Navigation Robot Using MicroPython and MQTT

A modular MicroPython-based robotic platform built to simulate indoor autonomous navigation using MQTT-based communication, ultrasonic and IR sensor feedback, and decentralized control logic. Designed for adaptability in dynamic environments with support for occupancy detection and real-time coordination.

## Features

### Autonomous Navigation
- IR-guided movement via `IRLineNav.py`
- Obstacle detection and avoidance using ultrasonic sensors (`hcsr04.py`)
- Real-time room-based pathfinding in `r2auto_nav.py`

### MQTT-Based Control System
- Full MQTT Publisher/Subscriber framework (`compilepubsub.py`, `subscriber.py`)
- Multi-node communication across devices and environments
- Laptop and ESP32-compatible setup

### Occupancy-Aware Logic
- Scans and adjusts to room occupancy (`r2occupancy.py`, `r2occupancy2.py`)
- Supports re-routing and fallback behavior via `r_backupmove.py`

### Modular & Testable
- Decoupled architecture: sensor, motor control, and communication layers
- Test utilities (`display_test.py`) and legacy support (`oldcompilepubsub.py`)

## System Overview

The system is designed around three core layers:
1. **Sensor Layer**
   - IR sensors (for line navigation)
   - HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor (for distance and obstacle detection)

2. **Communication Layer**
   - MQTT publishers (on ESP32 and laptop)
   - MQTT subscribers (robot, laptop for debugging)
   - Topics include room state, movement commands, and occupancy updates

3. **Control Layer**
   - Modular movement: forward/back/turn via `r2mover.py`, `r2moverotate.py`
   - Navigation logic maps rooms to destinations dynamically
   - Occupancy-aware pathing for realistic use-cases

##  Requirements

### Hardware
- ESP32 board
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- IR Line Sensors
- Push buttons / OLED display (optional)
- Laptop with MQTT broker (Mosquitto)

### Software
- MicroPython (flashed on ESP32)
- Paho MQTT (for laptop-side scripts)
- Thonny IDE / Visual Studio Code
- Mosquitto Broker installed locally or over network

---

## Getting Started

1. **Flash MicroPython** on your ESP32 board.
2. Upload the scripts using Thonny or ampy.
3. Connect to your Wi-Fi network and set MQTT broker IP in:
   - `compilepubsub.py`, `laptopsubpaho.py`, `publisher.py`, etc.
4. Start the broker (Mosquitto) on your laptop or server.
5. Run `compilepubsub.py` on the ESP32 to activate robot logic.
6. Monitor/control using `laptopsubpaho.py` or `subscriber.py`.

|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `r2/room/state`        | Room occupancy updates                 |
| `r2/move/command`      | Movement instructions (FWD/BWD/STOP)   |
| `r2/scan`              | Environmental scan trigger             |
| `r2/feedback/ultra`    | Ultrasonic distance data               |
| `r2/control/override`  | Manual override commands               |
